		<h3>Benefits of AI</h3>
		
		<p>AI have a low error rate compared to humans, if properly coded. They would have incredibel prescision, accuracy, and speed.<br>
		They won't be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us
		<br>this can even include mining and digging fuels that would be hostile for humans.
		<br>AI also can replace humans in repetitave, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.
		<br>AI also acts as an assitants in search engines as it can predict what a user will type, ask, search and do.
		<br>The impressive thing about AI is it doesn't sleep, rest, take breaks or get entertained to do its work.
