			<center><h3>Benefits of AI</h3></center>
			<p style="color:#696969">AI have a low error rate compared to humans, if properly coded. They would have incredibel prescision, accuracy, and speed. AI saves time and reduce errors<br> caused by human, for example an accountant can make mistakes in his calculations and that's normal for "HUMAN"<br>
			but, AI can perform this calculations in less time and with nearly 0% errors.<br><br>
		They won't be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us
		<br>this can even include mining and digging fuels that would be hostile for humans.
		<br><br>AI also can replace humans in repetitave, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.
		<br><br>AI also acts as an assitants in search engines as it can predict what a user will type, ask, search and do.
		<br><br>The impressive thing about AI is it doesn't sleep, rest, take breaks or get entertained to do its work<br><br>
		AI serves in cost reduction and increased efficiency.</p>
