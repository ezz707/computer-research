			<p style="color:#696969">Artificial Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, it's like a simulation to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.<br>In computer
		science, artificial intelligence, sometimes called machine intelligence, is any device that perceices its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
		successfully<br>achieving its goals.</p>
			<p style="color:#696969">The field of AI research was born at a workshop in 1956, where the term Artificial Intelligence was<br>coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics,
		He and other students produced programs that the press described as "Unbelievable".<br>Computers were learning checkers game's sstrategies, and it was reported that they played
		better than the average person.<br>Further more they were learnt to solve word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems, solving some logical problems.<br>
		In late 1990s and till now, AI began to be used for logisctics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other scientific fields.
		<br><br>Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence is known as narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task(Facial recognition or internet searches)<br>
		, however, the long-term goal of many reaserchers is to create a strong AI that can outperform humans in general, this might be benefit but also risky.</p>
			<p style="color:#696969">The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best to achieve a specific goal<br><br>
			When anyone hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. Which is because films and novels demonstrated a human-like machine that<br>
			takes control on earth, which is not true.<br><br>
			AI is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimix it and execute different tasks, from the simple to the most complex<br>
			one. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, perception.</p>
