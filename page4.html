		<center><h3>Myths about AI</h3></center>
		
		<p style="color:#696969">AI is going to take away jobs, in fact, AI "WILL" change the existing jobs and create new ones, which is a great thing.<br>
		AI is smarter than people. IT's funny when people thinks about that when the fact is it's programmed by human, it's just a matter of speed and accuracy<br>
		Companies don't need an AI strategy. Well, the fact all companies nowdays need an AI strategy.<br>
		AI will make medical desisions and diagnoses, that's true but it won't have the last word as the doctor is the one who decides every thing.<br>
		Developing strong-AI robots will end up with a robot invasion. Which is only in movies and novels and far away from being real.</p>
