			<center><h3>How AI can be harmful</h3></center>
			<p style="color:#696969">Many researches agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate<br><br>and that there's no reason to expect AI
		to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent.<br><br>Instead, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two senarios may happen.<br><br>
		The frist senario is that an AI is programmed to be a weapon, in the hands of the wrong person<br>these weapons could easily cause mass destructions, moreover
		an AI arms race could lead to an AI war that also results in mass destructions.<br><br>
		The second senario is that AI programmed to do a certain task could develop a destructive method to achieve its goal.<br><br>This can happen whenever we fail
		to fully align the AI's goals with ours, which is stikingly difficult.<br><br>
		These senarios illustrate the concern about about advanced AI, a superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, but if this goals
		<br>aren't aligned with ours we will face a great danger.<br><br>
		There are other harmful effects due to AI which includes: 
		<br>-Rise of unemployment.
		<br>-Computers can get hacked and data may fall in wrong hands.
		<br>-AI can be unpredictable: as machines become more intelligent, their thinkings can be unpredictable.
